This app is crafted entirely in Swift using SwiftUI. The project takes advantage of multi-threading, publisher-subscriber patterns, and robust data persistence. 

It adheres to the MVVM architecture and integrates Combine along with CoreData. 

The cryptocurrency data for this app is sourced from CoinGecko's free API.
